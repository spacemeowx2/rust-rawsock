    /**
    Obtains list of available network interfaces.

    Each of returned interface names can be further used to open interfaces.

    **Note:** each library may support different set of interfaces.
    This is because different libraries support different network interface types and some of them
    add to the list virtual interfaces (such as pcap "any" interface or pfring "zc:eth0").
    The same function called with pcap library will return different set of interfaces than run with pfring.
    However in both cases the returned interface list will be supported by currently used library.

    # Example

    ```no_run
    extern crate rawsock;
    use rawsock::open_best_library;
    use rawsock::traits::Library;

    fn main(){
        let lib = open_best_library().expect("Could not open any library.");

            .expect("Could not open interface");
